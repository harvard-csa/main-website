            I’m Lily, from Hinsdale, Illinois! I love playing with cats, taking
            2-hour naps, searching up in-depth movie analyses after I watch
            them, and listening to Mitski. I'm always down to waste time to talk
            about questions with no answers (in order to procrastinate) or
            rewatch La La Land for the 100th time.
